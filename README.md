Hello Everyone!



I am Joshua Bien V. Igros, 21 years old and 3rd year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Urdaneta City University. I am committed and constantly loving my course because this is what my heart’s desire and what makes me happy and fulfilled. With that, I yearn to learn more about graphic designs, software developers and many more. Learning these will prepare me for a better future that’s ahead of me and be competent enough to be an Information Technologist someday. Along with these, new informations excite me the most, because I get to broaden my knowledge and discover informations I haven’t known before. Furthermore, I enjoy playing online games and spending my time with my significant others. These are just brief informations about me and I really love to share it with you.
